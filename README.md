# A simple and fast Rust implementation of a Simulated Annealing Algorithm for the PACE 2024 challenge.

## Brief description

- The algorithm first constructs an initial solution using the well known mean heuristic.
- Then, it runs a Simulated Annealing using simple shift moves.


## How to build and run?

Rust has to be installed on the system: https://www.rust-lang.org
This version was tested with Rust 1.78.0
- To Build: `cargo build --release`
- To Run: `cargo run --release`
